This project is an Alexa skill that allows users to search for products and get recommendations using the RapidAPI Amazon Product Search API. 
The skill features product search capabilities where users can simply ask Alexa to find specific products, and it also provides product recommendations based on popular choices.
To set up this skill, you need to have Node.js installed on your local machine, an Amazon Developer Account, and an AWS Account. First, go to the Alexa Developer Console and create
a new skill with a name of your choice. Set up the skill’s language model with the SearchIntent (including a slot for product) and RecommendIntent. Save and build the model.
Next, set up an AWS Lambda function in the AWS Management Console. Create a new Lambda function using the Node.js runtime, and copy the provided code from index.js into the Lambda function editor. Make sure to set your RapidAPI key in the code. Set up an Alexa Skills Kit trigger for the Lambda function and deploy it.
Link this Lambda function to your Alexa skill in the Alexa Developer Console.
Once deployed, you can test the skill using the Alexa simulator or a physical Alexa device. Example phrases include “Alexa, ask Product Search to find iPhone cases” 
and “Alexa, give me a product recommendation.”
